## Installation

### Dependencies


For Linux-based operating systems, the tkinter (GUI) library needs to be installed extra (e.g. for Debian based systems):

```
sudo apt install python3-tk -y
```

If you are using it in an environment where you do not have root privileges (e.g. a HPC environment) contact your administrator to install it for you.

For using it on the ISTA cluster, some python versions have tkinter installed and some do not. Versions which worked, as of now (21.09.22): 3.10.1, 3.10.4, 3.10.6, 3.9.9, 3.9.13

Clone the git repository or install via pip:

```
pip3 install git+https://git.ist.ac.at/bsinger/microprev.git
```

Invoke the program with:

```
python3 -m micro_trasher --directory </directory/with/MRC files>
```

The other possible parameters are:

``` 
microtrasher.py [-h] [--images_per_row IMAGES_PER_ROW] [--directory DIRECTORY] [--contrast CONTRAST] [--brightness BRIGHTNESS]
                  [--image_width IMAGE_WIDTH]
