### Dependencies

```
pip3 install numpy mrcfile
```

For the Python Image library:
```

sudo apt install python3-tk -y
```

Clone the git repository or install from pypi:

```
pip3 install microtrasher #TODO - so far this is fake news
```

Invoke the program with:

```
python3 -m preload.py --directory </directory/with/MRC files>
```

The other possible parameters are:

``` 
preload.py [-h] [--images_per_row IMAGES_PER_ROW] [--directory DIRECTORY] [--contrast CONTRAST] [--brightness BRIGHTNESS]
                  [--image_width IMAGE_WIDTH]
